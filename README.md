There are 3 distinct services:

- [Auth API] - Creates authentication tokens to valid users.

## Requirments
- Ensure the ports are different for each of the services.
- Ensure Docker Daemon is running.
- Ensure Redis is installed and running.
- Ensure to always be in the right directory.


## Start-Up Processes

- Build all the docker images by getting to the directories of each of the services and running `docker build .`.
- Start the local enviroment with `Docker-compose up`.
- Install all the requirments for each service. 
- Run the application depending on the python version running on your local machine.
